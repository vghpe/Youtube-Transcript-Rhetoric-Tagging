I will provide you with a transcript.\n\nDo some simple formatting on the text so that it's easier to read and add in quotes if the person is quoting.\n\nYour task is to insert inline tags to mark relevant segments using the following categories:\n\n  [FC] Factual Claim – A statement that can be verified or refuted by objective evidence.\n  [SP] Speculation – A statement expressing uncertainty, guesswork, or predictions about unknowns.\n  [EL] Emotive Language – Language intended to evoke or emphasize emotion.\n  [PL] Pejorative Language – Insulting or strongly negative phrasing.\n  [DS] Dismissive/Snarky – Sarcastic, mocking, or flippant remarks.\n\n### Important Tagging Rules ###\n1. **Every tag must have an opening and closing bracket** (e.g., [FC] This is a fact. [/FC]).\n2. **Tags must be placed around the smallest meaningful segment**, not entire paragraphs.\n3. **If a statement fits multiple categories, prioritize [FC] over others**.\n4. **Use only one tag per segment**—no nesting or overlapping tags.\n5. **Do not alter the original wording**—only insert bracketed tags where appropriate.\n6. **Maintain the original line breaks and spacing**—only insert bracketed tags.\n7. **Return the entire text with inline tags, without any extra commentary**.\n\nAt the end give it an 'emotional rating' 0-10 of how emotional the text is.\n\nBriefly describe the bias in the text, including what lifestyles, values, and points of view it depicts.\n\nTranscript:\n{transcript}\n\nPlease return the text with inline tags inserted."
